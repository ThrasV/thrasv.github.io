Brothers is a local fitness centre based in Nicosia, Cyprus. The clients are the two trainers that run the fitness
centre, Demetris and Marios. The two brothers are both personal trainers and they are always there for what their
customers need. The identity needed to reflect strength, weight and muscle in association with the feeling of assurance
and trust towards the two brothers. The printing cost needed to be low, so we used only one colour print on diffrent
colours of paper.
